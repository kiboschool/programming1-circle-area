# Area of a Circle

Write a function `area_circle` that returns the area of a circle. It should take in the radius as an argument and use the circle area formula to find the area. Return the area.

## Testing

To check your solution manually, call the function with some sample values and print the result. Compare the printed value with the result of calculating by hand, or using an internet circle area calculator.

Run the automated tests using `python3 test_main.py`

## Hint

You can import the `math` library and use `math.pi`, or hardcode a value for pi.
